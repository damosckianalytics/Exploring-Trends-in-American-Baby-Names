# Exploring-Trends-in-American-Baby-Names

# Overview

This project analyses trends in American baby names from 1920 to 2020 using data from the United States Social Security Administration. The goal is to identify patterns in name popularity, observe long-standing favourites, and compare historical trends with recent naming conventions. Understanding such trends can provide valuable insights not only for parents but also for businesses interested in consumer preferences.

# Objectives

- Investigate how baby name preferences have evolved over the past century.
- Identify names that have maintained popularity over time.
- Compare classic names with modern naming trends.
- Analyse the impact of societal changes on naming conventions.

# Data Source

The dataset is sourced from the United States Social Security Administration (SSA). It contains:
- Year: The year the name was recorded.
- First Name: The given name of the baby.
- Sex: The gender of babies assigned the given name.
- Number: The total count of babies given that name in a specific year.
For efficiency, the dataset only includes names that were assigned to more than 5,000 babies in a given year.

# Tools Used

- SQL (for querying the dataset)
- datalab (for executing and sharing the analysis)

# Insights
